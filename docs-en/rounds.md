# Differences between rounds

Game rules will be slightly changed in between rounds.
Detailed game configurations can be seen in `presets` folder of the app for local testing.

In one game 6 participants and 114 bots will fight - 120 units in total.

## Round 2

In the second round you will be given two units, but you will not be able to damage friendly units.

Also extra lives will be given, and spawning will not be instant.

Amount of ammo in the beginning will be less than in the first round.
